In Project 2, you will be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep
track of players and matches in a game tournament.

Project 2 was designed to teach you how to create and use databases through the use of
database schemas and how to manipulate the data inside the database. This project has two
parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions) in tournament.sql, and writing
code that will use it to track a Swiss tournament in tournament.py.
